# Sandbox WebApp

This is a sandbox web app using spring boot. It includes the files required for getting up and running with Node, Grunt and the some of the more common Grunt taks such as watch and JSHint.

### Version
0.0.1

### Tech

It's using a number of open source projects to make development faster and easier:
* [node.js] - https://nodejs.org/download/
* [npm] - https://www.npmjs.com/
* [Grunt] - https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt
* [Spring-boot] - http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

### Installation

To fire up the spring boot application, from the root directory execute

```sh
$ bootRun
```

To get started with Node, make sure you have it installed and from the root directory run:

```sh
$ npm install

You can execute all the current Grunt tasks once using:

```sh
$ grunt
```
You can execute all the current Grunt tasks once using:

```sh
$ grunt

Start a grunt watch task using the following. This will automatically copy files across to the deployed localhost instance as you make changes to them.

```sh
$ grunt watch
```

### Development

This is just for making things easy.
